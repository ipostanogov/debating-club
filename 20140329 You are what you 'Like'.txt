You are what you 'Like'. March 29th, 2014. Proposition. Win.

Good afternoon honorable members of the house, chairman and the members of the proposition team. As it was said our motion for today is called "You are what you 'Like'". 'Like' is really an invention for social media marketing recommendations and ads targeting. You can find it in Facebook and Vk, as plus one in Google Plus, retweet in Twitter, and also in Formspring, Youtube, etc. What I'm going to do now is to show that 'Like' reflects emotions, goals and social relations which form the core of personality. So let's get started. 

Let's begin with emotions. I think everybody would agree that 'Like' is spontaneous. No one has a plan what photos, videos & posts he or she is going to 'Like' in the next week. 'Like' corresponds to the current mood of the person but additionally estranges from the content. It may be too rude or too naive for posting one selves but they are the real feeling in one's soul. It means that 'Like' really reflects emotions.

Ok, now let's look at undoubted popular subset of publics of educational, success, business and fitness thematic. They gather information which helps in goals achieving. People who 'Like' posts, want to save them and to share this achieving intension to others. 'Like' is a new way of public promise which is well-known to be an additional motivator in goals achieving. It means that 'Like' reflects goals.

Let's finish with social relations. 'Like' is used as a way to start talking with person, e.g. with some stranger pretty girl. Some people 'Like' friend's notes because nowadays messages without 'Likes' mean that author has no influence and followers in real life. Also, if you accidently added your teacher of head from your work, it such a typical to 'Like' their messages too. It means that 'Like' reflects & helps to build social relations.

To sum up, 'Like' reflects emotions of the person, goals of the person and owns social relations. These three things form the core of personality which means that 'Like' really reflects the person.

That's all. Thank you for your attention.
